# User Stories
## These user stories are all set from the player's perspective, with an explanation of how I have addressed each of them
<ul>
  <li>I want setup to be quick and easy. - I have added calibration at the start of the game which changes the scene based on the controller meaning that the table can be placed anywhere. I can now set up in less than a minute as opposed to the 20 minutes it took before adding this feature.</li>
<li>As someone who is sensitive to VR, I don't want to feel nauseous while playing. - I have addressed each of the main factors contributing to VR nausea in the market research.</li>
<li>I want to be able to feel more like I'm firing a real gun than in other VR shooting games. - The physical mechanism provides kickback  as opposed to the standard controller vibration used in other games. This will be custom since nerf guns and similar don't offer enough force and would require tearing apart anyway.</li>
<li>I want to be able to feel surfaces that I can see in the game. - The edge of the building aligns with the table so that can be felt, and the gun will be a real model with a vive tracker meaning that that can be felt.</li>
<li>I want multiple forms of feedback which relate to the setting. - A desk fan will be used to create the wind on the rooftop, as well as audio for wind and gun sounds.</li>
<li>I want to be able to intuitively reload and fire the gun. - By using a gun model mirroring the in-game model to the best of my ability, the interaction will be more intuitive than trying to operate a gun using the vive controllers.</li>
<li>I don't want to feel restricted by wires. - Aside from the headset wires which I am unable to change, there will be no other wires which tether the user to the computer. I will do this by sending any data across wirelessly via the vive tracker.</li>
</ul>
