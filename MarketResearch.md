## Walk the plank
In this VR experience, participants are taken up in a lift to the top of a building where there is a thin plank extruding out over the edge.
<p>A board is used in reality in order to give the sensation of the edges.
Giving players this tactile response to the VR world makes it more realistic and it feels like they're really on a high plank.
This VR experience playes on the sense of fear of heights and gives very obvious involuntary participant reactions.</p>

<p>I plan on taking the barebones of this concept where the player is high up on a building and is able to feel and look over the edge.</p>

* "Instead of just trying to recreate real life, we should create what we canâ€™t in reality"
Although you can go to the top of a building and walk along a plank in real life, most people wouldn't be willing to do so. A lot of equipment and harnesses would be required.
* "One of the most important aspects of designing for VR is spatial audio"
I will try and incorporate audio, but it may not be possible within the scope of the project.
* "Players expect to interact with objects as they do in the real world"
Offering players more real world feedback aids immersion.
