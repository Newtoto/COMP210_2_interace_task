## Walk the Plank - Fear of Heights
In this VR experience, participants are taken up in a lift to the top of a building where there is a thin plank extruding out over the edge.
<p>A board is used in reality in order to give the sensation of the edges.
Giving players this tactile response to the VR world makes it more realistic and it feels like they're really on a high plank.
This VR experience playes on the sense of fear of heights and gives very obvious involuntary participant reactions.</p>

<p>I plan on taking the barebones of this concept where the player is high up on a building and is able to feel and look over the edge. Being a sniper would be an alternative situation where the player might be on a roof</p>

* "Instead of just trying to recreate real life, we should create what we can’t in reality"
Although you can go to the top of a building and walk along a plank in real life, most people wouldn't be willing to do so. A lot of equipment and harnesses would be required.
* "One of the most important aspects of designing for VR is spatial audio"
I will try and incorporate audio, but it may not be possible within the scope of the project.
* "Players expect to interact with objects as they do in the real world"
Offering players more real world feedback aids immersion as shown by the plank edges.
* "Scale is very important for compelling VR experiences"
Making sure objects are the correct size will be a focus.
* "it’s essential to consider that your players can look anywhere they like"
Since a sniper would be covering up, this could be accounted for by making the view behind the player of some kind of fabric.
* "Bring as much of the player as possible into the VR experience  – head, hands and body, if possible"
Having hands on the gun when held would aid immersion.
* "Don’t leave them feeling sick or dizzy"
I will have to do further research into VR nausea to avoid this.

* Scale: Suggestion of playing around with scale, links with a quote in the previous article about playing around with things that you wouldn't neccessarily do. I'm not sure if this can be applied to the sniper idea, unless you were super small or large in the game. It would most likely be super small since that would be more stealthy, but I don't think this would integrate well with the concept.
* Communication: Backs up the importance of 3D audio from before, but uses it more in the context of a online social VR experience, which is way beyond the scope of this project.
* Immersion: VR is said to have had real world impacts on people such as increased dontations to charity and relieving drug addiction It has also been used in advertising Thomas Cook holidays, and Marriot hotels. I don't plan on changing the world with this VR experience since the psychological research that would be required to do it competantly is beyond the time frame.
* Flexibility: Real world applications such as interior design can be aided by VR, although this is an interesting use, is tricky to offer physical feedback for user-created worlds.
* Interaction: Similar to the previous point, there are uses for VR such as 3D moddeling, or interacting with 3D data visualisations. I do not have any data that would be valuble to represent in 3D space. Another example of an application of VR is <a href = "https://www.unit9.com/project/samsung-bedtime-vr-stories/">VR Bedtime Stories</a>, where a parent can connect with their child in VR an read them a bedtime story when they're away from home.

## <a href = "https://www.vive.com/uk/vive-tracker/">Vive Tracker</a>
The vive tracker allows for the tracking of any object it is attatched to. In the context of my game, this would enable me to use a Nerf gun or similar, track it, and have it appear inside my VR game. This would mean the player would get the physical feedback of the whole gun, improving immersion.
